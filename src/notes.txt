REMAINING ISSUES AND TO-DOs

allow code for different scenes
    group_corners:  vector<Point2f> -> vector<vector<Point2f>> 
    noo:  bool -> vector<bool>
    add scene to function args

remove 3D smoothing

remove t_lost threshold and replace with condition if marker is out of the frame (look at mono-vo...)

try out on different scenes and acquisitions
